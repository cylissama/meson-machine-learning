###### ECMWF MOOC Machine Learning in Weather & Climate Course

# Tier 1 - ML in Weather & Climate

## Introduction to ML in Weather & Climate

Numerical weather prediction
- the model 
- the observations
- the supercomputer

1. collect the observations
2. data assimilation
3. forecast models
3. product generation

Full Earth System
- ocean, land, atmosphere

Model development
- constantly updated
- large mesh of data

Ensemble forecast

Climate mongering capabilities, flood forecasting, risk of forest fire, atmospheric conditions

Q: why machine learning?
- detecting outliers and problems within existing methods and datasets
- improve forecasting
- make models for specific data
- these models can recognize complex relationships not clearly identified by humans
- automate time sensitive tasks
- detect climate events in real time
- emulate missing variables
